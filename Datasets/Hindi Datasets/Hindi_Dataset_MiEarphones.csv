Best in this price


M using it from 1 year and it is good product. Before that I was using local hand free . Or frnds one month mai hi ek side se aawaj aani band . Or ek side se use mai to nahi kar sakta lead. It's better ki compny ki lo 6 month B chale to local jitna hi kharcha aaega. Or bhai mai bhot ruffly use karta hu. Ab tak koi prob nahi mujhe. Mere frnd n relative ko B mene dilai hai same ye hi lead n unki B abtak kharab nahi hui. Aakh band karke le lo yaar.

Very Bad Wire Quality


इसकी तार की गुणवत्ता बहुत खराब है। आवाज अच्छी है लेकिन तार टिकाऊ नहीं है। यदि आप यात्रा और रोजमर्रा के उद्देश्य के दौरान उपयोग करते हैं तो मैं अनुशंसा नहीं करता हूं।Its wire quality is very poor. The sound is good but the wire is not durable. I do not recommend if you use during travel and everyday purpose.

Worst earphone


They are just making us fool. I have bought an earphone one weak before and now this earphone is stop working. Iska microphone kharab ho Gaya aavaj hi nahi jati h.So I would say never buy this earphone. Agar minus m start dene ka koi system hota to Mai minus m inko rate krta 400₹ ka ghar hua h mujhe.
